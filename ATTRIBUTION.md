## How to Add Attribution

When downloading images with [image-studio](https://github.com/hoyere/unsplash-image-fetcher), the metadata is saved automatically. Add entries to this file with:

1. Image path relative to `src/assets/images/`
2. Source (Unsplash, Pexels, client-provided, etc.)
3. Photographer name and profile link (for stock photos)
4. License type
