# GA Universe Voice Guide

> Content tone, humor style, naming conventions, and copy formulas for GA Universe templates

## The GA Universe Concept

GA marketplace templates use **deadpan occupational displacement** — a humor style where Growth Automations (a systems/automation company) earnestly runs businesses in other industries. The comedy comes from applying tech/SaaS vocabulary and values to hospitality, trades, and service industries.

**The premise:** "What if a systems-obsessed automation company ran a restaurant/barber/HVAC business?"

**Why it works:**
- Templates remain fully functional and professional
- Humor creates a cohesive brand across the marketplace
- Easy for buyers to identify what's "GA flavor" vs. structural content
- Demonstrates the template without generic Lorem Ipsum

## Humor Style: Deadpan Absurdism

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Deadpan** | Present absurd concepts with complete sincerity |
| **Occupational displacement** | Tech/SaaS vocabulary applied to other industries |
| **Self-aware but not winking** | Committed to the bit; never breaks character |
| **Gentle, not mocking** | We're not making fun of tech culture or the industry |

**Think:** Parks & Recreation earnestness, not Silicon Valley satire.

## Naming Conventions

**Business Name:**

GrowthAutomations [Industry Term]
```
- GrowthAutomations Brewing Co.
- GrowthAutomations Barbershop
- GrowthAutomations Climate Systems (HVAC)
- GrowthAutomations Legal Group

**Tagline Formula:**
```
[Industry craft] + [systems/automation concept]
```
- "Craft beer that runs like clockwork"
- "Precision cuts. Systematic style."
- "Climate control, fully automated"

**Service/Product Names:**
Name services after the *process*, not just the outcome:
- ✅ "Systematic Pale Ale" / "Precision Porter" (beer)
- ✅ "The Calibrated Cut" / "Process Fade" (barber)
- ✅ "Scheduled Maintenance Protocol" (HVAC)
- ❌ "Dave's Famous IPA" (too generic, no GA flavor)

---

## Wordplay & Puns

**Puns and wordplay are encouraged** throughout GA Universe content. Names, services, headlines, and descriptive copy can all use industry-related puns — as long as they remain professional and accessible.

| Where | Puns Encouraged | Examples |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Fictional staff names | ✅ Yes | Industry tool/term puns |
| Service/product names | ✅ Yes | Process + craft wordplay |
| Headlines & taglines | ✅ Yes | Blend systems + industry terms |
| Testimonial names | ✅ Yes | Subtle puns welcome |
| Menu item descriptions | ⚠️ Light touch | Keep functional but can be playful |
| Form labels / CTAs | ❌ No | Clarity over cleverness |

**Good puns are:**
- Groan-worthy but not cringe
- Immediately understandable (no obscure references)
- Related to the industry's tools, techniques, or terminology
- Delivered deadpan (never acknowledged as jokes)

---

## Staff & Team Guidelines

**Eric Hoyer** — The founder. Appears in every template as Owner/Founder. Real person, genuine bio that connects GA's mission to the industry.

**Fictional Staff Names** — Use punny names based on industry tools, techniques, or terminology:

| Industry | Example Names | Pun Source |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Brewery | Barley Hopper, Porter Stout, Amber Lager | Beer ingredients/styles |
| Barbershop | Cliff Trimmer, Harry Shears, Buzz Fademan | Cutting tools/styles |
| HVAC | Doug Ductson, Flo Ventura, Cole Compressor | Equipment/parts |
| Restaurant | Basil Sauté, Pepper Grillman, Rosemary Stockton | Ingredients/techniques |
| Plumber | Drew Pipeline, Flo Waters, Wade Copper | Pipes/water terms |
| Electrician | Watts Current, Amber Ohm, Ray Circuit | Electrical terms |

**Staff Archetypes** (adapt names per industry):
| Archetype | Role Type | Name Style |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Operations/Process | Manager, Director | Tool or process pun |
| Technical/Craft Expert | Head [Role], Lead | Material or technique pun |
| Customer Experience | Front of House, Client Relations | Friendly-sounding pun |
| Creative/Marketing | Events, Brand | Style or trend pun |

**Bio Formula:**
Write bios as if for a SaaS company, but for the industry role:
```
[Punny Name] brings [tech-adjacent skill] to [industry craft].
[They] developed our [systematic approach to industry task].
```

Example (Brewer — "Barley Hopper"):
> "Barley brings precision science to the art of brewing. She developed our automated fermentation monitoring system that ensures batch-to-batch consistency."

Example (Barber — "Cliff Trimmer"):
> "Cliff brings precision engineering to the art of the fade. He built our scheduling system that eliminates wait times without rushing the craft."

Example (HVAC — "Flo Ventura"):
> "Flo brings thermodynamic precision to residential comfort. She designed our dispatch optimization system for same-day response."

---

## Copy Formulas

**Hero Stats** — Apply SaaS metrics to the industry:
| Industry | Example Stats |
|----------|---------------|
| Brewery | "99% Batch Consistency" / "24 Fermentation Sensors" |
| Barber | "12-Minute Average Wait" / "98% On-Time Appointments" |
| HVAC | "4-Hour Response Window" / "99.2% First-Visit Resolution" |
| Restaurant | "8-Minute Ticket Time" / "Zero Reservation Errors" |

**Testimonial Formula:**
Customers should praise the *systems* as much as the product:
```
"[Genuine product praise]. [Observation about how smoothly things run]."
```
- "Best IPA in Portland. And I've never waited more than 2 minutes for a pour."
- "Great haircut, but what impressed me was the zero-wait booking system."

**Section Headlines** — Blend craft language with systems language:
- ✅ "Systematically Delicious"
- ✅ "Precision Pours, Every Time"
- ✅ "Where Craft Meets Clockwork"
- ❌ "Our Awesome Menu!" (too generic)
- ❌ "Disrupting the Brewery Space" (too Silicon Valley)

## What to Play Straight

Not everything should carry the humor. These elements should be **genuine and functional**:

| Play Straight | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Menu items / service descriptions | Buyers need real examples to customize |
| Prices | Must feel realistic |
| Contact information | Functional template element |
| Legal pages | No jokes in Terms/Privacy |
| Form labels | Usability over cleverness |
| Error messages | Clarity is critical |

The humor lives in **framing** (headlines, bios, stats, testimonials), not in **utility** (forms, navigation, core content).

## Alignment with Brand Guidelines

Per `Growth_Automations_Brand_Guidelines.md`, the voice must feel:

| Brand Trait | How It Applies to Voice |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Calm** | Never frantic, hyperbolic, or salesy |
| **Neutral** | Humor is gentle, never mocking or edgy |
| **Professional** | Copy is polished; jokes don't undermine credibility |
| **Human** | Warm, not robotic; systems serve people |
| **Durable** | No slang, memes, or trends that will date |

**Avoid** (per brand guidelines):
- ❌ Flashy or hype-driven copy ("AMAZING!" "BEST EVER!")
- ❌ Trend-chasing references (current memes, TikTok slang)
- ❌ Aggressive humor (sarcasm, snark, punching down)
- ❌ "AI magic" language ("powered by AI," "smart," "intelligent")
- ❌ Overly playful to the point of undermining professionalism
